Supplier Analysis

    Revenue by Supplier: The top four suppliers account for 40% of merchandise sales revenue. It's crucial to leverage bargaining power and manage risks of delays or cancellations.
    Revenue by Category: Beverages and dairy products each contribute 20% to the revenue, highlighting France's importance due to its key suppliers in these sectors.
    Revenue by Product Status: Nearly 20% of revenue comes from products that are or will be discontinued, necessitating discussions with suppliers to maintain or replace popular products.

Employee Analysis

    An organizational chart provides performance data, country, and position details. Hovering over an employee card reveals their biography.
    The U.S. outperforms the UK in revenue generation. Notably, King, who has worked in the U.S. office, shows superior performance. Consider promoting King and facilitating knowledge transfer.
    In the U.S., sales representatives show comparable performance, with Peacock, a former UK office employee, being the top seller. Employee rotation between offices is beneficial.

Shipper Analysis

    Freight by Shipper: United Package is the largest shipper, followed by Federal Shipping and Speedy Express.
    Delivery Time by Shipper: United Package has the longest delivery time, while Federal Shipping has the shortest.
    On-Time Delivery Percentage: The Time_To_Destination metric shows that Federal Shipping excels in on-time deliveries.
    Destination Time by Shipper: Confirms Federal Shipping's superior performance in timely deliveries.

Customer Analysis

    Profit by Country: Strong economies like the U.S. and Germany lead in performance. The UK's low performance suggests considering relocating the office to Continental Europe. Austria also significantly contributes to profit.
    Profit by Customer: Revenue distribution is broad, with Ernst Handel being a notable contributor in Austria.
    Contact Role Count: High numbers of owners and sales managers maintain contact with the company.
    Profit by Contact Role: Account Managers are the most profitable, likely due to their resource allocation responsibilities. The company's approach should focus on these contacts. Despite their frequency, owners contribute less to profit, reflecting smaller company sizes.
